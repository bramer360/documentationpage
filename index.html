    <header>The 911 Concept</header>
    <p>With the 911, Ferry Porsche and his son Ferdinand Alexander created a sports car icon that has fascinated us for over 50 years. The secret to their success: a harmonious overall concept with a timeless design and – as our engineers sometimes call it – unique technical layout. 2+2 seats are the ideal concept for a compact, thoroughbred sports car that also meets the challenges of everyday driving. The compact engine is located at the rear, thereby providing excellent traction and characterising the unmistakable driving feel of a 911. Since 1963, we’ve been steadfastly working to further perfect the 911 concept. And we’ve never been closer to reaching this goal.</p>
    <ul> The eight generations of 911:
      <li>1963: The original 911</li>
      <li>1973: The G Series</li>
      <li>1988: 964-introduces AWD</li>
      <li>1993: 993-first biturbo engine</li>
      <li>1997: 996-moves to water cooling</li>
      <li>2004: 997 generation</li>
      <li>2011: 991 generation</li>
      <li>2019: 992 generation</li>
      </ul>
    <p> The eighth generation of the 911 is the sum of its predecessors – and therefore a reflection of the past and a vision of the future. The silhouette: iconic. The design: timeless. The technology: inspired by great racing victories and always one step ahead. The result is both the most beautiful and most modern version of the 911. Full of memories, yet also full of clues as to how we can shape the future of the sports car. This makes the 911 a timeless machine. 'The Timeless Machine'.</p>

<p>Only a single line is required to describe the 911: the so-called flyline with a longer, flatter lid, steeply inclined windscreen and gently rearward sloping roof line. It characterised the original 911 for over 50 years and finds its highly contemporary counterpart in the current 911.</p>
<p>To appreciate the design of the 911, it's best to begin where its heart beats: the rear, where its horizontally opposed engine is to be found. Surrounded by a powerful rear end that has permanently shaped the proportions of the 911. The rear end is clearly and precisely designed. Straight lines, with an evident horizontal orientation. Focusing on the essentials.</p>

  <p>Good design should be pioneering, as should the technology. The interior of the 911 is, therefore, blazing new trails – in that it reflects old strengths and expands new possibilities. The principle: analogue precision meets digital integration – as always, strictly aimed at the driver.</p>
  <p>The horizontal orientation of the interior is striking. All the relevant operating controls are located, within grasp, to the left and right of the multifunction sports steering wheel. And therefore directly adjacent to the driver. A principle that distinguished the first three generations of the 911 – for a clear and light interior architecture and exceptional ease of use.</p>
  <p>Directly in view: the instrument cluster with the analogue rev counter as the central element. To the left and right of this are two high-resolution 7˝ displays that provide all the essential car information on virtual instruments. Right beside this: the high-resolution 10.9˝ touchscreen display of Porsche Communication Management (PCM).</p>

<p>The engine of the 911 models has a twin-turbo configuration. Its stand-out qualities: exceptional power across the speed range, extraordinarily direct responsiveness and a wide torque plateau, even at low speeds. In short: excellent performance that responds to the driver in an instant.</p>

  <p>The enhanced 8-speed Porsche Doppelkupplung (PDK) allows extremely fast gear changes without interrupting the flow of power – now even by a millisecond. In comparison to previous generations, the 8-speed PDK offers a perceptibly wider middle ground between comfort, performance and efficiency.</p>
  <p>PDK is essentially two gearboxes in one. This double-clutch arrangement provides an alternating, force-locked connection between the two half gearboxes and the engine by means of two separate input shafts. The flow of power from the engine is transmitted through one half gearbox and one clutch at a time, while the next gear is preselected in the second half gearbox. During a gear change, one clutch simply opens and the other closes at the same time. The result: extremely short switch times with no interruption in the flow of power – in short, extremely sporty tuning. This is mainly noticeable in gears one to six. These have a sports ratio, with top speed being achieved in sixth gear.</p>
  <p>And what about efficiency? Also high. Because thanks to the additional eighth gear, the increments of the two overdrive ratios (gears seven and eight) are even better coordinated, as is their connection to the sixth gear. Which helps to keep engine revs low, even at high speeds. Thereby improving efficiency and comfort over long distances.</p>

   <p>PASM is an electronic damping control system that actively and continuously adjusts the damping force on each wheel, based on current road conditions and driving style – for reduced body roll and thus for improved comfort and increased dynamics.</p>
   <p>PASM has two settings which can be selected using a button above the centre console: in ‘Normal’ mode, the shock absorption is a blend of sporty and comfortable and in 'SPORT' mode, it is much firmer.</p>
   <p>The new valve technology enables the damping forces to be much more widely spread and more accurately controlled – and noticeably faster. High damping forces can also be achieved even at low speeds. The results are tangible: increased driving stability, improved comfort – and above all, more athleticism in every situation.</p>
